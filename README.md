# ðŸŽ’ Solving the Knapsack Problem Using Genetic Algorithm

This project demonstrates how to solve the Knapsack Problem using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). It includes the implementation of a GA in Python, loading knapsack problem instance, executing multiple runs, and analyzing the results in terms of fitness, execution time, and memory usage.

## Objectives

- Implement a Genetic Algorithm for the Knapsack Problem.
- Load and preprocess knapsack problem instance.
- Run the GA multiple times to evaluate its performance.
- Analyze results including best fitness, execution time, and memory usage.

## Technologies

- Python 3.13
- **pandas** â€“ data handling and organization
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** â€“ visualization of results
- **numpy** â€“ core computations for GA
- **memory-profiler** â€“ measurement of memory usage
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ interactive development environment
- **uv** â€“ package manager

## Execution

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/marcosnevary/knapsack-ga.git
   cd knapsack-ga
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```
   uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab
   ```
